Feedback for MAINARDI, LUCA:

Part 1
Model 1 accuracy: 55.35.
Grade: 5.8 / 7 
[Graded on a linear scale between 50% accuracy (7/10) and the best score in class, 62.11% (10/10), then scaled to 7 points]

Feedback on architecture:
Architecture is okay but explanation is only describes your current model, not what you tried and found.

Feedback on data augmentation and regularization:
Learning curve looks good Dropout, Batchnorm, and Data augmentation is done.

Feedback on training parameter tuning (learning rate, batch size,...):
There is no motivation or hyperparameter tuning for batch size, learning rate, optimizer, or number of epochs.

Grade: 5.75 / 7
